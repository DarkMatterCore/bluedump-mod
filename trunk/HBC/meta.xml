		<release_date>20140226161500</release_date>
		<short_description>Title and save manager</short_description>
		<long_description>YABDM is a modification of BlueDump capable of dumping any type of title installed in your Wii console to a WAD file in a SD Card or an USB storage device. It can also backup and restore savegames in their unencrypted form. 

This version was heavily modified to fix bugs and add some corrections that make the WAD dumping process more accurate; that means, the resulting files now match with the WADs obtained with NUS Downloader and other PC applications. Thus, BlueDump can actually recreate the original WAD used to install certain title.

=== Usage ===

* Savedata: When you load YABDM, you will see a menu with "00010000 - Disc Savedata", etc. If you want to backup EG: GH World Tour, to Disc Savedata (set arrow and press A) and then set the arrow on SXAP and press 1. An option menu will open, from there you can use the right and left arrow to switch between the functions because we want a backup now, select Backup Savedata and press A. Voilà, you now have a backup of your savedata for that game in sd:/YABDM/Savedata/DISC SXAP.

The same things applies if you want to backup savedata for a VC title: just go to "00010001 - Installed channel titles" (savedata can be installed on any Wii).

* Titles: go to, for example, "00010001 - Installed channel titles" then set the arrow on like "4a4f4449 - Homebrew Channel". Press 1, select Backup to WAD and press A. The WAD is now in sd:/YABDM/WAD.

=== Changelog ===

YABDM v0.91 (February 26th, 2014 - DarkMatterCore):

* Fixed a very silly regression bug in the name reading code.
* Fixed GCN Controller compatibility. For some odd reason, the controller input acts erratically using the DetectInput() function, so for now I'm just reverting back to the old waitforbuttonpress(). I swear I received my controller just a moment ago; otherwise, I wouldn't have noticed that.

YABDM v0.9 (February 26th, 2014 - DarkMatterCore):

* Rewrote the title name reading functions from scratch. The application can now read multilingual names and descriptions from contents stored on the NAND filesystem and content.bin files using the IMET and WIBN structs from Wiibrew, and the __convertWiiString() function from AnyTitle Deleter by bushing.
* Improvements to the save dumping/flashing code.
* Minor cleanup to the WAD dumping code. The application will now also check if the Ticket and/or TMD data is already fakesigned before trying to wipe the signature.
* If you choose to fakesign the TMD, the application will now display a prompt asking if you want to change the WAD region. This is done by modifying the value @ 0x19D in the TMD, just like FreeTheWads on PC.
* A "(vWii)" suffix will be displayed along with the System Menu version if the application is running under vWii (thanks to JoostinOnline and crediar for their IsWiiU() check).
* Updated libruntimeiospatch to v1.5.1.
* Updated application headline and meta.xml credits to reference HacksDen.com.

YABDM v0.8 (September 24th, 2013 - DarkMatterCore):

* Added support for title 00010000-HAZA. It is the responsible for controlling the Photo Channel "swap" between versions 1.0 and 1.1. When it is present, v1.1 is displayed in the System Menu; otherwise, v1.0 is used. Since it gets installed to the savedata directory, it was not being treated as a title, thus its dumping was not allowed; now this behaviour is fixed. Thanks to Iwatasan for noticing this!
* Compiled with the latest libogc git revision from 09/04/2013.
* Now using the latest libruntimeiospatch revision. The previous version was not properly patching the hash_old[] pattern because it had the same value as new_hash_old[]. I informed Excelsiior about this and the change has now been made to the GitHub repository.

YABDM v0.7 (September 15th, 2013 - DarkMatterCore):

* Changed application name to YABDM (Yet Another BlueDump MOD).
* Added a proper fix for DetectInput(): now calling VIDEO_WaitVSync() instead of using a while loop (thanks to JoostinOnline!).
* Changed the AES / Rijndael implementation from Mike Scott in favor of a faster one by Vincent Rijmen, Antoon Bosselaers and Paulo Barreto (slightly modified by Jouni Malinen), known as "rijndael-alg-fst". This one uses previously created AES tables instead of generating them everytime an encryption / decryption operation is done, and it also allows the use of a single memory block to be modified 'in-place'. Thus, the dumping process is now faster.
* The OTP memory is now mounted once instead of accessing its data everytime Content_bin_Dump() is called in the application.
* The application now generates a name list for all the entries in a directory everytime the current path is changed. This is mainly done to reduce loading times, and to avoid reading ALL the names again when a D-Pad button is pressed. Because of this, the names for the content.bin files saved in the SD card are now properly displayed on screen; you'll only have to wait a bit after pressing +/R.
* Thanks to the previous point, I noticed a memory leak in getdir_info(), because the *ent pointer was used to allocate memory with malloc() regardless if it already pointed to a memory address. It is now freed before reusing it.
* Some other optimizations.

MOD v0.6 (September 7th, 2013 - DarkMatterCore and JoostinOnline):

* Added compatibility with content.bin files stored in SD:/private/wii/title. You can switch between normal WAD dumping and content.bin conversion modes with +/R.
* Added code to read the OTP contents and copy them to a previously aligned memory block. This is needed to access both the PRNG Key and the Console ID, which are used in the content.bin conversion process.
* Added compatibility with Classic Controllers (thanks to JoostinOnline!).
* Optimized name reading functions. Instead of allocating a memory block and then returning it (which is unsafe), now a single global character string is used, with its current value being updated by using snprintf() (thanks to JoostinOnline!).
* Added meta.xml argument support to enable or disable the logfile creation without having to recompile the entire application (thanks to JoostinOnline!).
* New sexy, smexy icon (thanks to JoostinOnline!).
* Some other changes and simplifications that reduce the overall CPU use (thanks to JoostinOnline!).

MOD v0.5 (August 27th, 2013 - DarkMatterCore):

* read_name_from_banner_app() and read_dlc_name() functions are now merged.
* Fixed a bug in the read_name() function which would return wrong text if the title has contents smaller than the size of the chunk read into memory (e.g. YouTube Channel, it has two 'dummy' contents of 0x40 bytes each).
* Fixed a *possible* buffer overflow in the read_name*() functions, since they were allocating 'length+10' bytes for the name buffer and then the description string was concatenated to it (which is usually longer than 10 bytes). Now, they're just allocating enough space for what they need.
* Fixed left button behaviour.
* More code changes.

MOD v0.4 (August 26th, 2013 - DarkmatterCore):

* Ability to read the internal channel descriptions. Not all channels have this, though, but it still is a nice feature.
* Button 2 / X is now used to change the view mode between hexadecimal IDs and ASCII IDs.
* Added padding to 64-byte boundary for the footer data (I noticed that the official WADs from game discs have this, so why not?).
* Mostly, code optimizations.

MOD v0.3 (August 24th, 2013 - DarkMatterCore):

* Fixed a very silly bug in the GetContent() function that would improperly dump content files smaller than 16KB using a null IV in the encryption process (I used the Mario Kart Channel to test this behaviour, since it has two contents that match this case).
* The WAD backup section of the dump_menu() function was completely revamped to avoid redundancy (it seriously had a lot of unnecessary code). Plus, the name scheme of the dumped WADs was changed to be the same from CustomizeMii and similar applications.
* Now using conditional operators for most checks on the 'isSD' value.
* Some other little corrections.

MOD v0.2 (August 15th, 2013 - DarkMatterCore):

* Now using libruntimeiospatch by Excelsior to apply patches to the current IOS.
* Fixed illegal FAT characters on dumped savegames. They are now replaced with an underscore (_).
* Added full support for contents bigger than 45MB. The GetContent() function was completely rewritten to dump each regular content file in chunks of 16KB, which are read, encrypted and saved to the output WAD. Because of this, the encrypt_buffer() function is not used anymore in GetContent(), since we need to change the Initialization Vector (IV) for each chunk.
* Other minor fixes and corrections.

MOD v0.1 (August 1st, 2013 - DarkMatterCore):

* Full hardware access through the HW_AHBPROT flag (must use HBC v1.1.0 or later!). The IOS patches applied include the "KillAntiSysTitleInstall" set from damysteryman, so the application is also fully compatible with the vWii mode available in Wii U.
* Added an IOS selection screen at startup (you can select whether you want to use the full hardware access, or a patched IOS).
* Full compatibility with USB storage devices and GCN controllers.
* Ability to choose if you want to fakesign the WAD ticket and/or TMD before starting the dumping process (no secondary version needed anymore).
* If you select to fakesign the WAD ticket, the application now wipes the console ID and the ECDH data from it; both of those can prevent a successful WAD installation on another Wii. It is also verified if the Common Key Index value (0x1F1) is set to 0x01 or 0x02; if so, it is changed to 0x00.
* The certificate chain (cert.sys) is now embedded on the code, to avoid reading it every time from the NAND.
* Complete overhaul in the name reading functions for channel banners and banner.bin file from savegames. Plus, the application now can also read names from installed DLCs.
* The WAD footer is now added to every title dumped from the application. Its size is added to the WAD header @ 0x1C, too.
* The content.map file is now read into memory once for every dumping process, instead of accessing it every time the application dumps a shared content.
* Compatibility with content type 0x4001 (which is only present in DLCs, AFAIK).
* Fixed a bug in GetContent() where the application would allocate memory for two different buffers with the same size, which could exceed the console memory limit if the content size was greater than ~22.5 MB. Now, a single memory buffer is used for all the dumping, padding and encrypting operations.
* The pad_data_32() function is now called pad_data(). It uses a bool value to determine if the input buffer will be padded to a 16-byte (0x10) boundary, or a 64-byte boundary (0x40). To avoid memory problems, it now uses realloc() to change the size of the already-allocated input buffer, instead of allocating memory for a new buffer.
* The decrypted memory buffer is now padded to a 16-byte boundary before encrypting. Then, the encrypted memory buffer is padded to a 64-byte boundary. That way, the WAD structure used by NUS Downloader can be easily recreated, with amazing results (just see it by yourself).
* Before reading the internal name of a given title, it is now verified which type of title is it to use the appropiate function for its case. That way, the logfile won't be full of ISFS_Open() -106 errors when trying to read the banner.bin file for everything. lol
* Added a switch case function to properly output the System Menu version in the browser screen (e.g. "v513" is now displayed as "v4.3U").
* Ability to use the LEFT/RIGHT buttons in the browser screen (why didn't nicksasa add that...?).
* Output font replaced with another that has full Unicode support. That way, the title names can be displayed properly if you have set your console in Spanish or a different language.
* Compiled with the latest libogc, devkitPPC and libfat versions (as of August 1st, 2013: v1.8.12, r26 and v1.0.12, respectively).
* Compatibility with the new WiiMote Plus (RVL-CNT-01-TR).

Alpha 3:

* Show IOS names (for example, IOS36).
* Show IOS versions (for example, IOS 249 v18).
* Disabled logging by default.
* Code cleanup.
* Creating folders correctly now if they don't exist.
* Some more stuff I forgot.

Alpha 2:

* Backup savedata from VC/WiiWare and Disc games.
* Restore savedata from VC/WiiWare and Disc games.
* Backup title's to WAD (correctly signed, will only work on your own wii if you use the normal version!).

Alpha 1:

* Never released.</long_description>
