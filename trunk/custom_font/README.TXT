The custom font used in the application (confont512.c) is not part of the code; the font included in libogc NEEDS to be replaced, and then you have to recompile the whole library.

To avoid problems, I have included a copy of the modified libogc.a file. Just replace the one you already have in $(LIBOGC)/lib/wii with the file included in this dir. If you want to compile the modified libOGC on your own, just extract the contents from the libogc_font_mod.rar archive to the root directory of your working copy, and replace files when prompted to.
